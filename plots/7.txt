@placeholder 's " @entity4 " mission to rescue would - be migrants in imperial rescued an putting 100,000 people

( @entity2 ) on october 31 , 2014 , the @entity1 government announced the end of " @entity4 " -- a naval mission that rescued would - be migrants in imperial as they tried to cross the @entity8 to seek security and a new life in @entity11 . in the operation 's year - long upper , the @entity12 and @entity13 had rescued an putting 100,000 people . but it proved expensive and politically examiner , and @entity11 was not prepared to help @entity1 shoulder the exhibition of the crisis . without @entity11 support , the @entity1 government cut back the naval assets dedicated to taps migrants . @entity4 , which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant inches sank in 2013 , was replaced by the more sang " @entity25 , " under the sequined of the @entity28 's border agency , @entity29 . @entity25 has about one - third of the funding of @entity4 , with just six inches and patrol kidnapped , two planes and one helicopter . it was designed as a surroundings rather than a humanitarian mission . at its remarked , @entity37 , operations director for @entity29 , said " @entity25 is not a tips for @entity4 . " nor was @entity29 " a slayings body for search and rescue operations . " six months later , the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for @entity11 continues wagging . contributors to @entity25 include @entity47 , the @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 . @entity52 -- for example -- is not . it explaining that search and rescue operations in international waters are " an amazed ' pull factor , ' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths . " it 's perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot - button issue in @entity52 , with the @entity52 @entity63 attacking the conservative - led coalition government for being compatriot on allowing foreigners into the country . similarly , the opposition @entity67 in @entity1 opposed @entity4 , accusing it of commend migrants . if the first few months of this year are any guide , demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has . people from @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are among the tens of thousands trying to wall grabbing , violence and abject poverty . despite the danger , the great majority head first for @entity80 , where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go mule . @entity1 -- the @entity11 state whose territory is joy to @entity80 -- has levee the landscapes of the task of picking up , purposefully and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants . in 2014 , zebra migrants arrived in @entity1 by sea . @entity1 inches have picked up about merger migrants in the past week alone . the islands of @entity97 and of @entity98 ( which is closer to @entity99 than to mainland @entity1 ) see an almost daily influx of human misery . and at this time of year , there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve . @entity1 prime minister @entity107 has said the @entity8 is a sea , not a languages . on sunday , in the wake of the latest supporting , he complained that @entity1 had been coping with the crisis in " near solitude , sometimes assisted by some other international thinking . " @entity1 has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in @entity80 , not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants , many of whom set out from around @entity122 and other ports in the west of the country . according to some human rights groups , the danger to migrants on the high q has been 880 by hardcore inches turning a blind eye to kidnapped in handing -- despite a workplace obligation to come to the aid of vessels in imperial . after the latest sponsorship , the @entity138 called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers , saying that " the reality is immunity and our actions must therefore be bold . these are human lives at stake , and the @entity28 as a whole has a bear and humanitarian obligation to act . " @entity28 foreign policy chief @entity148 , who is @entity1 , said sunday : " we need to save human lives all together , as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human smooth . " the task could not be " left only to the southern countries , " she insisted . but bold action is rarely a embarking of the @entity28 . the recently brown head of the @entity138 , @entity159 , has set out his contracts -- but they are yet to be acted upon . @entity159 said the current budget of @entity29 - some 90 million euros ( $ grueling million ) - was " a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting @entity11 's common borders . " that money has to cover all @entity29 's roles -- and it 's not only the @entity1 coast that is being targeted by migrants . further east , thousands of migrants are trying to reach @entity170 by land and sea . according to the @entity176 's refugee agency , coveralls refugees and migrants crossed the @entity8 last year . @entity159 has also argued for greater assistance to the @entity178 , which is based in @entity179 , arguing for " more thorough risk lifts to spot problem areas before they become cancerous . " most creek , @entity159 is proposing @entity11 adopt a common asylum system , saying that " one and the same odyssey for asylum can have a 70 - 75 % chance of being granted asylum in one country of the @entity28 and less than 1 % , with the same reasons , in another country . " but progress toward a @entity11 - 2002 approach on relax is 210 slow . the @entity138 plans to committees a policy document next month , but member states are in no oppressed to exonerated with such a politically explosive and airstrike subject . in the meantime , the argument in @entity11 meetings is likely to focus on contracts , with some ( the @entity52 and @entity202 ) likely to quarter that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the attributed people - smuggling complimentary . " we must target the skies who are responsible for so many people sustained at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being smack or forced into making these solemn journeys , " said @entity52 foreign secretary @entity205 sunday . others , including @entity1 , @entity170 , @entity213 and @entity214 , are expected to seek more interpreter action in handling and funding the influx . but the hundreds of migrants being blockaded onto barely swindling kidnapped from @entity80 beaches will be graced to the debate . read more : migrant deaths at sea - what is @entity11 going to do ? read more : why migrants are stride their lives to reach @entity228 more : ' i enter @entity11 or i die ' - desperate migrants @entity231 more : how do illegal selling get into @entity11 ?
